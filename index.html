    <h2>Thoughts on Progrssive Enhancement</h2>
    <p>Progressive Enahncement is a website design philosophy that focuses on building a foundational layer of content. Then adding another more advanced layer with all the bells and whistles later.
    With progressive enhancement I like that the focus is planning out your website in advance and getting the basics done first. It allows you to do fixes and relatively easy instead of trying to figure out a site design baseed off of Graceful Degradation.
    A big feature of PE philosophy is the approach towards older technology or browsers. When designing websites through PE the other focus is for the content to be accessible across many browsers and meant to work with a usuer's older technology.
    I believe Progressive Enhancement is important because through its design the content will reach the biggest number of people, whether you still have an Iphone 4, need a screen reader, or dont have the fastest wifi speed PE is designed and practiced to accomadate all of those problems. </p>

   <h2>Space-X Project Reflection</h2>
   <p>Taking a look back on the project I can easily say that the styling portion of the project is was my toughest challenge. I feel like my brains just goes haywire when thinking of all the elements nthat need space, sizing, fonts, and positioning.
      Couple that with all the various troubleshooting an amateur developer, like myself, must learn to identify easy fixes whilst remembering any single typo in the list of code can bug up your work. All that makes for a big year full of learning a completely different language and its semantics. My peer review issues were mostly the styling issues as I could not for the life of me figure how to fix those blank boxes 
      and positioning the content well. I believe the things I did well were the html side of things, though I'd like to go more in depth on that as still some of the more detailed semanitcs like your classes and roles confuse me. This class has had a profound change on me as now I can appreciate website creation and programming these complex things. Everytime I see a cool website or some new user interface feature I think of this class and our discussions.
      If i were to start this class over I definitely wouldn't have missed any days as the large volume of learning in a single class is hard to make up for unless your beyond motivated. Along with that getting more hands on with CSS is something I would do looking back. As for the feedback on the images being put off to the side in the space-x project I did try to fix it. I realized at first the naming conventions were off in my html and thought that was causeing my images to behave weird. But after fixing that I still couldn't get them to work.
